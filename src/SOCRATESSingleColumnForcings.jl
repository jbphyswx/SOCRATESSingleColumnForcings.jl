For the nnls_alg,
[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050917307858] explains the active and passive sets well.
[https://conservancy.umn.edu/server/api/core/bitstreams/ef5b0697-b7ea-4e5b-9d97-92b29a2f468e/content] chapter 2 points out that the pivot methods tend to be computationally optimal for NNLS (Kim and Park is in NonNegLeastSquares.jl)


The true profile shouldn't be incredibly spiky , and thus A\b should not induce many negative numbers in the A\b inversion). Thus the `active set` (numbers set to 0 because they violated the nonnegativity constraint) is usually small, so we usually don't need many iterations to find a solution

Because A is usually tridiagonal (maybe septadiagonal at worse for cubic splines) the inversions which might ordinarily be expensive are actually quite fast -- caching doesn't seem to improve performance.


Some sample timings with A = (1000x1000) and tridiagonal (but full matrix type, not LinearAlgebra.Tridiagonal) and M = (1000,) is fully dense and not sparse (few zeros):


@btime nonneg_lsq($A, $M; alg=:nnls) evals=2 samples=2  # doesn't support `tol`
    1.027 s (13 allocations: 7.68 MiB)

@btime nonneg_lsq($A, $M; alg=:nnls) evals=2 samples=2 


@btime nonneg_lsq($A, $M; alg=:fnnls, tol=1e-12) evals=2 samples=2 
    6.200 s (22914 allocations: 3.71 GiB)
@btime nonneg_lsq($A, $M; alg=:pivot, tol=1e-8) evals=2 samples=2
    6.258 s (22914 allocations: 3.71 GiB)


@btime nonneg_lsq($A, $M; alg=:pivot, tol=1e-8) evals=2 samples=2
    33.881 ms (48 allocations: 38.25 MiB)     : This is 
@btime nonneg_lsq($A, $M; alg=:nnls, tol=1e-12) evals=2 samples=2
    35.031 ms (48 allocations: 38.25 MiB)

So, :pivot is over 150x faster, with about 100x fewer allocations than :fnnls, but does allocate more than :mmls

For the pivot variants, :cache and :comb

@btime nonneg_lsq($A, $M; alg=:pivot, tol=1e-12, variant=:cache) evals=2 samples=2
    909.911 ms (67 allocations: 76.54 MiB)

@btime nonneg_lsq($A, $M; alg=:pivot, tol=1e-12, variant=:comb) evals=2 samples=2
    932.510 ms (113 allocations: 76.54 MiB)

I thk the active sets are just too small for caching things to be worth it


The only quirk is that :pivot can leave some very small negative numbers in the solution, which we have to resolve to 0, but that's very fast to do.

This probably also explains why :pivot was the default in the original code.

Note if you're doing fully random matrices for A, :pivot was slower, but then that's not really a realistic representation of what the workflow would be for regridding input variables like this where A is sparse and has a real structure from the grid.
