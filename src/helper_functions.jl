the function will create splines along interp_dim_in...
- if we set interp_dim_out, we actually evaluate the function along interp_dim at locations interp_dim_out,otherwise, we just return our unevaluated spline functions

- data_func is a func to be applied to the raw data before it is processed, though perhaps it it most useful if interp_dim_out is unset and we are returning functions...
- vectorize_in means your input is an array and you need to loop over it too (as opposed to just being a fixed template vector)

Note the conservative_regirdder() returns actual output arrays -- it won't work if you are just creating a spline fcn
